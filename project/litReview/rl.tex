\subsection{Reinforcement Learning}
  \citet{onlineRL} propose a new online reinforcement learning method that can train models with minimal input data.
  In their paper, \citeauthor{onlineRL} describe the \textit{Reanalyse} algorithm.
  The \textit{Reanalyse} algorithm uses a machine learning model's state and input data from the environment to generate training targets for the model.
  When the model has improved by training, the \textit{Reanalyse} algorithm generates more training targets based on the new state of the model, the already seen input data, and any new input data.
  The algorithm cycles the available training data--this allows the algorithm to extract most of the information from a limited dataset.
