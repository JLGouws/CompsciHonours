\subsection{Reinforcement Learning}
  \citeauthor{onlineRL} \cite{onlineRL} propose a new online reinforcement learning method that can be used to train models with minimal input data.
  \citeauthor{onlineRL} describe the \textit{Reanalyse} algorithm.
  Given a state of a machine learning model the \textit{Reanalyse} algorithm generates training targets for the model from some input data.
  When the model has improved by training, the \textit{Reanalyse} algorithm generates more training targets based on the new state of the model, the already seen input data, and any new input data.
  The algorithm allows the available training data to be cycled--this allows the algorithm to extract most of the information from a limited dataset.
