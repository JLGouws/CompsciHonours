\subsection{Revised Project Conclusion}
This research uses the Tracking, Learning and Detection(TLD) framework to implement a system that can simultaneously track and detect multiple faces.
TLD is used in the research to develop a long-term tracker that can recognise human faces and follow the trajectory of the faces in a video stream.

The research tests the implemented system on public data.
Tests consist of having the system extract information about faces that appear in a given video stream.
The information collected by the implemented system is the number and duration of appearances for each target face. 

The research is limited to the tracking of faces and does not aim to track general objects or other human features.
Owing to the time limitations of an honours project, this project has substantial dependence on research done by other people and available tools.
