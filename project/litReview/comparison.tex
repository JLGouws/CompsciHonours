\subsection{General Comparison of Trackers}
  The Visual Object Tracking Challenge(VOT) is a challenge that benchmarks various trackers every year \cite{VOT2017, VOT2020}.
  VOT investigates both ST and LT.
  VOT has also introduced a real-time challenge \cite{VOT2020}.

  In the VOT 2020 challenge, most trackers use deep features instead of handpicked features that were predominant in the past.
  In the short-term tracking challenge, 86 \% of trackers used deep features.
  Deep discriminative correlation filters (DCF) \cite{danelljan2019} have succeeded in many recent VOT challenges. 
  Of the short-term trackers in VOT2020, 15 used deep DCF.

  All of the long-term trackers in VOT 2020 used convolutional neural networks.
  Several long-term challenge trackers use MDNet \cite{CNNTracking} as a basis for object presence detection.
  One of the long-term trackers used deep DCF; Another used siamese convolutional neural networks.
