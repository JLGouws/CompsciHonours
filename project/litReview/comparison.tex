\subsection{General Comparison of Trackers}
  The Visual Object Tracking Challenge(VOT) is a challenge that benchmarks various trackers every year \cite{VOT2017} \cite{VOT2020}.
  VOT investigates both ST and LT.
  In recent years, VOT has also introduced a real time challenge \cite{VOT2020}.

  In the VOT 2020 challenges the majority of trackers use deep features, instead of hand-picked features which were predominant in the past.
  In the short term tracking challenge 86 \% of trackers were seen to use deep features.
  Deep discriminative correlation filters(DCF) have seen a lot of recent success \cite{danelljan2019}, 15 of short-term trackers in VOT2020 also used deep DCF.

  All of the long-term trackers in VOT 2020 used convolutional neural networks.
  Several of trackers seen in the long term challenge are based on MDNet \cite{CNNTracking} to detect for object presence.
  One of the long-term trackers was based on deep DCF, and another used siamese convolutional neural networks.
