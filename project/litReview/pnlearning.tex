\subsection{P-N Learning} \label{sec:pnlearning}
  Training a tracker on a video stream is, in effect, bootstrapping a classifier online.
  \citet{PNLearning} offer a solution to training a binary classifier in a stable way.
  Stability in the tracker's learning is essential in avoiding tracker drift during the video progression.

  P-N learning consists of two components that evaluate the errors of the classifier every instant that new data become available, for example, every frame of a video.
  The first component is the P-expert which attempts to recognise the false negatives made by the classifier; the second component is the N-expert which identifies the classifier's false positives.
  These experts make errors; otherwise, they would make a perfect classifier by themselves.
  One component's mistakes can, with proper implementation, compensate for the other's mistakes which leads to stable learning \cite{Kalal2011}.

  Two-dimensional dynamical systems can model the P-N learning system \citep{PNLearning}.
  This model can be used to determine the stability of the learning.
