\subsection{Convolutional Neural Networks}
  Convolutional Neural networks(CNN) have been prominent in the field of Computer vision in recent years.
  CNNs have been used in field of computer vision in order to classify images with high accuracy and speed \cite{razavian2014}.
  CNNs come at the cost of requiring long times to train using GPUs \cite{krizhevsky2012}.
  This makes standard use of CNNs impractical for tracking unknown objects, training a CNN online reduces the tracking speed of the system \cite{bertinetto2016}.

  \subsubsection{Convolutional Siamese Neural Networks}
  \citeauthor{bertinetto2016} \cite{bertinetto2016} offer a solution to the problem of tracking an unknown object with Convolutional Neural networks.
  The solution given by \citeauthor{bertinetto2016} is to train, offline, a CNN that solves the more general similarity problem.
  A function $f(z,x)$ is learned, the funtion compares images $x$ and $z$ and returns a value that estimates how similar the images are.

  A siamese neural network, two identical neural networks conjoined at the output node \cite{bromley1993}, is used to learn the similarity relation.

  There has also been investigation into the use of Convolutional Neural Networks in tracking \cite{CNNTracking}.
  The work by \citeauthor{CNNTracking} offers high performance tracking of generic objects.
  The system implemented by \citeauthor{CNNTracking} requires a large amount of offline training.
