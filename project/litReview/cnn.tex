\subsection{Convolutional Neural Networks}
  There has also been investigation into the use of Convolutional Neural Networks in tracking \cite{CNNTracking}.
  The work by \citeauthor{CNNTracking} offers high performance tracking of generic objects.
  The system implemented by \citeauthor{CNNTracking} requires a large amount of offline training.
