\section{Learning}
  Consider a continious video stream that is being analyzed by a pre-trained tracking system.
  This video stream is a constant flux of information.
  The information contained in the video stream can, thus, be used to improve the tracking system.
  The requires learning mechanisms, specifically online learning--learning where information becomes available while the system is in operation.
