\section{Learning}
  Consider a continious video stream that is being analyzed by a pre-trained tracking system.
  This video stream is a constant flux of information, and some of the information might not have been encountered the tracking system's history.
  The information contained in the video stream can, thus, be used to improve the tracking system.
  Improving the system requires learning mechanisms, specifically online learning--learning where information becomes available while the system is in operation.
