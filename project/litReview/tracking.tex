\section{Tracking}
  Tracking is a versatile form of computer vision that is present in almost all forms of video analysis.
  The task of tracking is to determine the trajectory of an object in a video stream.
  
  Tracking is typically broken into two categories: short-term and long-term.
  Long-term tracking(LT) is tracking of objects that can undergo partial oclusions, change appearance, and disappear and reappear from the field of view.
  This is opposed to short-term tracking(ST) where the object remains fully in the field of view for the whole duration of tracking.
  ST can be used as a basis for LT, as is done in the case of TLD.
