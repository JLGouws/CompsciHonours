  Tracking objects in video streams is a powerful tool in computer vision.
  This research will investigate the recognition and tracking of multiple faces in settings where the faces are concurrently visible.
  The study will implement a tracking system that detects faces and tracks their motion in a video stream.
  The tracker requires data that define the faces of the targets to initialise itself.

  The initialised tracker will detect if a target face is present or absent in a frame of a given video stream.
  The tracker will identify any visible target and follow its motion. 
  %TODO fix these sentences
  If a target face disappears and later reappears in the video stream, the tracker will be able to identify and track it again, provided the target remains in the field of view.
