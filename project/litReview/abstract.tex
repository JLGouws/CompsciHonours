  Tracking objects in video streams is a powerful tool in computer vision.
  This research will investigate the recognition and tracking of multiple faces in settings where the faces are concurrently visible.
  The study will implement a tracking system that after, initialising with minimal input data, detects faces and tracks their motion in a video stream.
  The task of tracking starts by initialising the tracker with bounding boxes that define the faces of the targets in images.

  The initialised tracker will be able to detect if a target face is present in or absent from an arbitrary video stream.
  The tracker will identify any visible target and follow its motion. 
  %TODO fix these sentences
  If a target face disappears and later reappears in the video stream, the tracker will be able to identify and track it again, provided the target remains in the field of view.
