\section{Conceptual Methodology}
  The tracker developed in this thesis implements the TLD framework.
  This framework provides the conceptula basis for the implementation. 
  The final implementation aims to extend and improve on the original TLD system.

  \subsection{Reasons for using TLD}

    The TLD is a general framework that allows the design and development of long-term visual tracking systems.
    TLD does not put many restrictions on the design of the system.
    The framework can enable the development of a system that can follow a single target in a video stream.

    The framework modularizes the long-term tracking task.
    Modularization promotes abstraction which facilitates development.
    The abstraction provided by the TLD framework allows for simple ways to extend the tracking system.

    Other approaches to long-term tracking involve monolythic systems, for example, CNN based approaches.
