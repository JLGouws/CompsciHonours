\section{Practical Implementation Methodology}
  The implementation language of the tracking system is C++.
  The \textit{Open Computer Vision}(OpenCV) Library facilitates the implementation.
  Development of the tracking system uses these two tools.

  C++ is a compiled language.
  Being a compiled language, C++ can execute faster than interpreted laguages like python.
  In this way, C++ is suited to the task of real time tracking.

  ``OpenCV provides a real-time optimized Computer Vision''
  OpenCV is written in C++, hence developing the tracking system in C++ is appropriate.
