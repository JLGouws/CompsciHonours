\section{Research Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Using the TLD framework to build a system for idenitifying and tracking people in crowded scenes.
  \item
    Investingating ways to improve tracking and classification performance.
  \item
    Investigating ways to decrease the computation power required by the system.
  \item
    Developing ways to store the system state so that it can maintain it's learned parameters between instances.
  \item
    Improving the scalability of the system so that new tracking targets can be added easily.  
\end{itemize}
