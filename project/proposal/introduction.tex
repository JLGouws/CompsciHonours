\section{Introduction}
  Analysis of videos of crowds of people has many practical applications.
  Most real world situations that involve people have people that are moving.
  On top of that most often people are not isolated, but instead form groups of people.

  There is huge potential for research in these areas, and a reliable system with high performance would be very useful in industry.
  For these reasons it makes sense to investigate ways to develop a system that can efficiently and accurately detect and track multiple people in a video stream.

  In the past visual tracking has been a largely understudied field, but more recently there has been a significant increase in available tracking systems \cite{VOT2017}.
  Most trackers have niche target areas.
  A lot of trackers are very fast and accurate, but fail in the long term.
  Some trackers combat this long term failure \cite{Kalal2011}, but this often comes at the cost of performance \cite{Enriques2014} \cite{VOT2017}.

  There are ofcourse ethical concerns.
  As far as research and testing goes only relatively small datasets should be required.
  This data can be sourced from a group of volunteers, and so ethical concerns should not be a concern for development.
  But for serious real world applications investigation of larger datasets and an ethical clearance might be required.
