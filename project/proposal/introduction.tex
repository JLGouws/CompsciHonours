\section{Introduction}
  Analysis of videos of crowds of people has many practical applications.
  Most real world situations that involve people have people that are moving.
  On top of that most often people are not isolated, but instead form groups of people.

  For these reasons it makes sense to investigate ways to develop a system that can efficiently and accurately detect and track multiple people in a video stream.
  Tracking targets in a video stream is by and large an understudied field.
  The literature is relatively limited in comparison with the number of real world applications of tracking systems.
