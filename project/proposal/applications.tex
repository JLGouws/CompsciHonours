\section{Applications}
  This reaseach has multiple real world applications.
  One includes an automated class register that can be used in schools.

  Another approach on the larger scale is a security system for monitoring the motion of people.
  This could enhance airport security for example, maybe being able to label suspected terrorists.

  It also has potential to be used as an assistive technology for visually impaired people.
  If it can run on a mobile device, it might be able to help a visually impaired person identify people at a party or on a television program.
  This is assuming the system has had the offline training to be able to do so.
