  Tracking of objects in videos streams is a powerfull tool in the field of computer vision.
  It is, however, a relatively unexplored field when compared to other areas of computer vision.
  That being said, there have been impressive developments in the field in recent years.
  I propose to use methods of machine learning and image processing to further explore object tracking and detection.
  The specific focus of my research will be the detection and tracking of people in crowds.
  Another concern of the research is performance of the implemented system.
  A large amount of computation power is often needed to analyze videos of crowds, investigation into reducing the required computation power of this system will also be carried out.
