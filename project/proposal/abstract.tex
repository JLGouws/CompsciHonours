  Tracking of objects in videos streams is a powerfull tool in the field of computer vision.
  This research will investigate the recognition and tracking of mulitple faces in settings where multiple faces are concurrently visible.
  The research will take the form of implementing a system that can detect and track the motion of faces in a video stream after being initialized with minimal input data.
  The task starts by initializing the tracker with bounding boxes in images that define the faces of the targets. 
  Once the tracker is initialized, the tracker will identify and follow the motion of the targets in a video stream. 
  The tracker will be able to detect if a target face disappears from the video stream.
  If the target face reappears in the video stream, the tracker will be able to identify and track the face as long as the face remains in the field of view.
