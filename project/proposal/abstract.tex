  Tracking of objects in videos streams is a powerfull tool in the field of computer vision.
  It is, however, a relatively unexplored field.
  I propose to use methods of machine learning and image processing to further explore object tracking and detection.
  The specific focus of my research will be the detection and tracking of people in crowds.
  Another concern of the research is performance of the implemented system.
  A large amount of computation power is often needed to analyze videos of crowds, investigation into reducing the required computation power will be carried out.
