\section{Reseach Statement}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    Machine learning and computer vision techniques can be used to design and implement a system that, when given minimal input data, is capable of counting the number and measuring the duration of appearances of multiple target faces in a single video stream.
  \end{itemize}

  The central computer vision technique that is tested, by this research, is the Tracking, Learning, and Detection framework--discussed in Section~\ref{sec:relatedWorks}.
  The definition of minimal input data, in the context of this research, is a single image for each face that is required to be tracked, where each image includes a bounding box that defines the location of the face in the image and a label for the face.
  The goal of this research is to implement a working system that meets the conditions specified by the Research Statement.
