\begin{enumerate}
  \item The weights from the first layer to the second layer(first hidden layer) are supposed to represent the contribution of the pixels to little line segments.
        The sencond layer is supposed to pick up on small ``edges" or line segments.
  \item The weights from the second layer to the third layer represent collection of the ``edges" making up larger structures.
        These weights are supposed to represent the contribution of the small line segments to lines and circles.
        The weights for input into the final layer are supposed to represent how the lines and circles get added together to form the numbers.
  \item The weights are not coded or worked out by hand to represent this.
        A computer works out the weights.
        The network needs some starting values for the weights, these are set randomly for ease of use.
        Since the network starts randomly there is no reason for the training network to follow a human's semantic structure.
        The learning tries to find patterns that are natural for the network to recognize, which might not be natural/sensical to humans.
